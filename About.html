                <p>NetAfrica University, Nigeria is committed to Strengthening Electoral Processes in Nigeria and through her commitment, CDI deployed Election Observers across 30 local government areas which include the 8 mapped red zone Local Government Areas within the State towards the 2022 Osun Governorship Election. CDI also Partnered with other NGOs working on promoting transparency and accountability in elections towards active citizen participation.
                    This report gives an evaluation of our findings on the election day on INEC logistical preparedness, security agencies' performances, voter's turnout, and vote trading. It is worthy of note that Crownrise development initiative through research conducted discussed extensively the probability of vote buying; citizens' awareness, the vote buying perpetrator, and the approach to mitigate vote buying, among other issues with red zone local government areas prone to vote buying were highlighted in the pre-election findings. More importantly, Crownrise development initiative stressed the need for INEC to ensure proper training of staff and ensured the secrecy of the ballot is sustained by the staff of the commission during the voting time, prosecute any individual found culpable of vote trading, and ensured active collaborations among stakeholders among others.  Hot spot mapping here. These were the outcome of our findings on the election process and procedure during the 2022 Osun governorship election.</p>
                    <h2>Our Students</h2>
According to the report of CDI on Vote buying 76% of the respondents as well as citizens' sampled opinions affirmed that there will be vote buying and vote selling, likewise, there might be no difference between 2018 and 2022 in terms of Vote buying. Our pre-election findings confirmed the outcome on the election day as many of the political gladiators engaged/induced voters to collect money ranging from #5000 to #10,000 and also gave many of the voters money a night to the election day to ensure they have voters to their side. </p>
